## 2. THE EQUILIBRIUM PRICE EFFECTS OF POLLUTION POLICY


### 2.1 THE MODEL
Recall our simple model of a single price-taking firm from section 1.7 in Chapter 1.
There are two key elements of that model. The first is the relationship between emissions
and output:
(2.1) e = (1− x) y
The second is the production-cost function:


(2.2)
γ
(1 2 ) 2 c( y, x) x y +
=
where γ ≥ 0 is a production-cost parameter. We now extend that model to one with
multiple firms, where γ is idiosyncratic.



Output is homogeneous and
aggregate demand is
(2.3) Q( p) = a .bp
where a > 0 and b > 0 .

We begin by deriving the market equilibrium in the absence of regulation. This will serve
as a template for solving the more complicated problem when emissions are constrained.
Moreover, the solution that we later derive for aggregate abatement cost can be usefully
expressed in terms of the unregulated equilibrium values, so it is helpful to derive those
first.

### 2.2 MARKET EQUILIBRIUM WITHOUT REGULATION


#### Equilibrium Market Surplus
Market surplus is the sum of aggregate profit and consumer surplus. Aggregate profit is
simply equal to the sum of individual profits:


MS = Π +  CS


#### A Complication: Free Entry and the Number of Firms


The size of β in this example captures the extent to which firms differ.


In the limit as β →∞ , all firms are identical and Ω →α .
