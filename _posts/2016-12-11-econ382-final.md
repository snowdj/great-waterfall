### Nonrewable: mineral

Hotelling rule:

$$RENT_0 = PV RENT_1$$

 - efficient:
    $$MUC_0 = MB_0-MC_0$$
 - competetive market:
   $$RENT_0 = MUC_0 = P - MC_0$$
 - monopoly: 
   $$RENT_0 = MUC_0 = MR_0 - MC_0$$


### Recycling

$$MC_v = MC_r$$

### Energy



### 2 Fishery 

#### Problem set 4



the Gordon-Schaefer model of an open access fishery.



$H(E)$ and  $S(E)$ are all functions of Effort. 

The most important point is to using Effort as the choice effort other than the H or Quantity. 

The Open access optimal result is $P H(E) = TC = (w/P) E$ .






### 3 Forest resources



_Definitions_ 

**Current annual increment (CAI)** – year-to-year growth. We will
measure growth in terms of volume (e.g., cubic feet).

**Mean annual increment (MAI)** – average growth; stand volume
divided by stand age.

**Culmination age** – the age at which a 2mber stand reaches its
highest MAI.

**Rotation** – the planned number of years between the forma2on
of a tree crop or stand and its final cufng at a specified stage of
maturity.

**Hardwood** – trees that produce seeds with some type of covering.

**Softwood** – trees that produce seeds with no covering; usually
have needle- or scale-like leaves.

Juvenile phase (youth) - accelerating rate of growth.

Full vigour phase (maturity) - constant rate of growth

Senescent phase - decelerating rate of growth.

#### Problem set 4 

Question 2

Maximum volumn

maximum amount of biological growth. 

maximum average growth.




#### the Faustmann model

##### Discrete time and Continous time
optimal condition is 

$$ \frac{CAI(t) }{S(t)} = r   $$

where $CAI = \frac{d S(t)}{d t}$



#### the Faustmann rule



MB of waiting  = MC of waiting

$$ [P - Ch] \frac{d S(t)}{d T} = r \frac{[P - Ch]S（T） - Cp }{1-  e^{-rT}}  $$
