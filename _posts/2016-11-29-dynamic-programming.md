#### 9.1.1 Terminology

Path

Predecessor

Successor

Immediate Predecessor

immediate Successor

Origin (no predecessor)

Destination (no  successors)

Cycle

Acyclic graph

##### Problem Statement

Given  a  directed  graph  where  each  arc  is  assigned  a numerical  length, we want to find the shortest path between a  specified origin s  and a specified  destination t, where the  length of a path is equal to the sum of the arc lengths on that path.
